Download [2009 US County boundaries dataset](ftp://ftp.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2009/tl_2009_us_county.zip) and extract the file within the `data` folder. You should end up with the structure:

`./data/tl_2009_us_county/` and all the shp files etc in there.

Run the script and, hopefully, you'll end up with all the generated assets in the `output` folder.
